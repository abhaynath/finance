      <p>What Is the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio?</p>
      <p>
        The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) is the ratio for valuing a
        company that measures its current share price relative to its earnings
        per share (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as
        the price multiple or the earnings multiple.
      </p>
      <p>
        P/E ratios are used by investors and analysts to determine the relative
        value of a company&#x27;s shares in an apples-to-apples comparison. It
        can also be used to compare a company against its own historical record
        or to compare aggregate markets against one another or over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        P/E may be estimated on a trailing (backward-looking) or forward
        (projected) basis.

        <li>
          The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio relates a company&#x27;s share price
          to its earnings per share.
        </li>
        <li>
          A high P/E ratio could mean that a company&#x27;s stock is overvalued,
          or else that investors are expecting high growth rates in the future.
        </li>
        <li>
          Companies that have no earnings or that are losing money do not have a
          P/E ratio because there is nothing to put in the denominator.
        </li>
        <li>
          Two kinds of P/E ratios&#x2014;forward and trailing P/E&#x2014;are
          used in practice.
